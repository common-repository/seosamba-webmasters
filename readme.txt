== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How does the SeoSamba for WordPress Webmasters plugin work? =
SeoSamba for WordPress Webmasters plugin generates XML files on the fly. This means there’s NO physical file created in your root directory. This is expected by design.

Instead, your sitemapindex.xml file, as well as any number of supplementary sitemap XML file as mandated by your site’s size, are generated and served only when called by search engines and users.

You can verify everything works properly by calling that file from your web browser by typing in *http://yourdomain/sitemapindex.xml*.

Rest assured that this plugin cannot apply any visual changes to your website however.
